# TRIVIA API : Development and Documentation Final Project

## Trivia App

Trivia API is a game in which players can test their knowledge in different categories by answering trivia questions.

In Trivia App, we can:

1. Display questions - both all questions and by category. Questions should show the question, category and difficulty rating by default and can show/hide the answer.
2. Delete questions.
3. Add questions and require that they include question and answer text.
4. Search for questions based on a text query string.
5. Play the quiz game, randomizing either all questions or within a specific category.

## Get Started

The project is divided into two parts.
A backend part made in FLASK and a frontend part made in React. API documentation is located in the [backend](./backend/README.md)
### Frontend

The [frontend](./frontend/README.md) directory contains a complete React frontend to consume the data from the Flask server.

> View the [Frontend README](./frontend/README.md) for more details about installation of the frontend and running.

### Backend

The [backend](./backend/README.md) directory contains a Flask and SQLAlchemy server. 

> View the [Backend README](./backend/README.md) to learn more about installing the backend and how the API works.
